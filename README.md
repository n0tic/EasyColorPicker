# Easy Color Picker
I challanged myself to make a replica of "jcpicker" (Just Color Picker). The idea was to see if I could make similar features in C#.

Please note that this program is not nearly as optimized or as feature-rich as Just Color Picker.
Not my best work when it comes to clean code. It's a mess.

Keybinds:
- END - Capture color
- Delete - Deletes selected item in "Saved Color" list.
